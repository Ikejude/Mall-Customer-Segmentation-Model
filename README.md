# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-Model
This repository contains an unsupervised machine learning model for segmenting mall customers based on their purchasing behavior. The model aims to group customers into distinct segments to gain insights into their preferences and behaviors.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset that contains information about mall customers, such as their age, annual income, gender and spending score. The spending score is a metric that reflects a customer's purchasing behavior in the mall.

## Model Description
The customer segmentation model is built using unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering algorithms, to group customers with similar characteristics. By identifying distinct segments, the model helps understand different customer profiles and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

Key steps of the model development process include:

* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the input data to ensure consistency and suitability for clustering. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features.

* Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features that capture the essential aspects of customer behavior and preferences. This can be based on domain knowledge or through feature engineering techniques.

* Model Training: Employing clustering algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN to group customers based on their feature similarity. The model identifies natural clusters within the data.

* Model Evaluation: Assessing the quality of the clustering results using evaluation metrics like silhouette score or within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS). These metrics help determine the optimal number of clusters and assess the cohesion and separation of the clusters.

* Customer Segmentation: Assigning each customer to a specific segment based on the clustering results. This allows for targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

## Usage

To use the mall customer segmentation model, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

* Prepare your input data in a format that matches the required input of the model. Ensure the features are preprocessed and encoded as necessary.

* Load the trained model into your Python environment.

* Call the model's prediction function, providing the input data as arguments. The function will assign each customer to a specific segment based on their characteristics.

## Evaluation

Evaluation of the customer segmentation model can be performed using various metrics, such as silhouette score or visual analysis of the resulting clusters. Additionally, visualizations like scatter plots or t-SNE plots can help understand the separation and distribution of the customer segments.
